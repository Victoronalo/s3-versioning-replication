# s3-versioning-replication


Objective:
I am to create an S3 bucket, uploading enable versioning and configure cross region replication.



-I started by logging into my AWS management console.


-I navigated to the S3 on the AWS management console.


-I created an S3 bucket named “s3-versioning”.


-I proceeded to enable versioning on the bucket.


-I then uploaded files to the S3 bucket.


-I made some changes to the file and tested the versioning was working.


-I proceeded to test and check for the various versions available.


-I proceeded to the management module of the s3 bucket to configure cross region replication.


-I enabled it and indicated the source bucket.


-I also indicated the destination bucket for replication in another region.


-In the course of doing this project I came across some huddles but with the help of the team and the internet it was successful.


-Also it is worth noting that a lot was learnt in the course of this project.
